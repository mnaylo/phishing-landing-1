      <p>Had you been interacting with an actual phishing email, cybercriminals could have obtained important user credentials and later used them to log into other company computer systems 
      without our knowledge. In the future, look out for the <strong>”Red Flags”</strong> explained below.<p/>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> The senders email address has a mis-spelling. The email was not from <u>someone@dropbox.com.</u></p>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> The email is telling the user to click a link, hovering over the <u>View or download</u> link shows it will not go to Dropbox.</p>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> Why did you receive this email? Were you expecting to receive such an email from a known business contact?</p>
      
      <p>Thank you for participating in this security awareness training exercise. Please use the knowledge you gained to spot and report future Phishing emails!</p>
